# 📘 EduSummariser

EduSummariser is a **custom-built Language Model developed from scratch using PyTorch**, trained on educational content and deployed as a **web-based LLM-style application**.  
The project focuses on understanding the **core working of Large Language Models**—from tokenization and self-attention to training, inference, and real-world deployment—while operating under limited computational resources.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Custom **decoder-only Transformer (GPT-style)** architecture
- Educational **text summarization and explanation**
- **SentencePiece (BPE)** tokenizer for efficient token handling
- End-to-end **training and inference pipeline**
- **FastAPI backend** for model serving
- **Gradio / Streamlit frontend** for interactive usage
- Fully **Dockerized** application
- **Cloud deployment** using modern ML platforms

---

## 🎯 Project Motivation

Most existing summarization tools either:
- Use **rule-based techniques** (low quality), or
- Depend on **closed-source pretrained APIs** (limited learning value)

EduSummariser was built to:
- Understand LLMs **from first principles**
- Avoid black-box dependencies
- Be deployable in **low-resource environments**
- Demonstrate a complete **ML + DevOps workflow**

---

## 🧠 Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- Build a **Mini LLM from scratch**
- Train it on educational datasets
- Deploy it as a usable **web application**

### Secondary Objectives
- Learn tokenizer design
- Understand Transformer internals
- Practice ML deployment and DevOps

### Out of Scope
- Billion-parameter models  
- Multimodal learning  
- Production-scale optimization

## 🚀 How to Run EduSummariser

### 1. Environment Setup
Clone the repository and create a virtual environment:

```
git clone "https://github.com/AbhinavvNair/EduSummarizer.git"
cd EduSummarizer
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Verify Model Files
Ensure your trained model and tokenizer are in the data/ directory:
```
data/edullm_model.pt (Weights)
data/tokenizer.model (SentencePiece model)
```

### 3. Launch the Web Application
Run the backend server using Uvicorn. This will serve both the AI API and the HTML frontend:
```
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 4. Access the Interface
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
UI: http://localhost:8000
API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
```
